# Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict stock prices using historical market data. Key highlights:
- **Feature Engineering**: Moving averages, volatility, and lagged prices.
- **Modeling**: Ridge Regression with polynomial features.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics like MSE and MAE via K-Fold Cross-Validation.

This project showcases my skills in:
- Python programming
- Machine learning
- Financial data analysis
- Data visualization

## Key Features
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes moving averages, lagged price values, and volatility calculations.
- **Modeling**: Implements Ridge Regression with polynomial features for enhanced prediction capabilities.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Employs K-Fold Cross-Validation to assess metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Visualizations**:
  - Actual vs Predicted Prices
  - Residual Plots to analyze errors
  - Distribution of errors and cumulative error progression
